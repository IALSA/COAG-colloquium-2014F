./Data
========================

The folder contains data files used in the project. 

<code>./Data/Extract</code> - contains the raw data files, as they were extracted after they were downloaded from the study source. Most of the times this folder is  never pushed to the cloud and resides on the local machine (change settings in .gitignore)  

<code>./Data/Derived</code> - contains a dataset, typically in .RDS format, that are the result of making measured data ready for systematic analysis.
