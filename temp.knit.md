<div class="notes">
This data flow map shows one possible scenario of data development, relevant to the data at hand. Stage <code>dsW</code>,  <code>dsLong</code>, might be optional, or narrate different transformations. The purpose of such a map is to organize our understanding of the script underlying this map. Thus, when results of the study are reported this map can be used to ease the deconstruction of the script and its further adaptation.
