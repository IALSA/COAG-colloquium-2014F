A key emphasis is on advances in the health, \ncognitive vitality, and well-being of an aging community. This colloquium series has been developed to \nhighlight both substantive and methodological innovations and applications in aging research. This fall, \nour colloquium series emphasizes data management and statistical analysis using R software\n(http://www.r-project.org/) and statistical models for identifying trajectories and transitions in \nlongitudinal studies and administrative health data. This fall series will be of general interest to \nresearchers and students who wish to increase their expertise in statistical analysis using R.    </br>\n\n**Location**: University of Victoria, Medical Sciences Building, Lecture Room 160  \n**Registration**: [Register](http://conferences.uvic.ca/index.php/coag/coagevents) for live streaming of lectures   \n**Time** : for all sessions 10:30 am to 12:00 pm PST  \n**Materials**: All accompanying project files are availible on [GitHub](https://github.com/IALSA/COAG-colloquium-2014F)\n\n</br>\n**This series is hosted in partnership with the [Department of Psychology](http://www.uvic.ca/socialsciences/psychology/), Education and Training Unit of [Population Data BC](https://www.popdata.bc.ca/), the [Island Health Research and Capacity Building Program](), and  the Integrative \nAnalysis of Longitudinal Studies of Aging ([IALSA](ialsa.org)) Research Network (NIH/NIA 1P01AG043362).**   \n\n ![ialsa][ialsa]    \n \n## Schedule of Events\n  \n- Tuesday, Oct 14, 2014 --- Toolbox and Skillset of Reproducible Research (RR) --- Andrey Koval (UVic)  \n- Tuesday, Oct 21, 2014 --- RR Basic Skills (1): Data Manipulation --- Andrey Koval   \n- Tuesday, Oct 28, 2014 --- Introduction to Latent Class and Latent Transition Models: Matching Models to\n Questions to Data --- Brian Flaherty (University of Washington)      \n- Tuesday, Nov 4, 2014 --- RR Basic Skills (2): Graph Production --- Andrey Koval     \n- Tuesday, Nov 11, 2014 --- Remembrance Day --- (No Session)  \n- Tuesday, Nov 18, 2014 --- RR Basic Skills (3): Statistical Modeling --- Andrey Koval    \n- Tuesday, Nov 25, 2014 --- RR Basic Skills (4): Dynamic Reporting --- Andrey Koval   \n- Tuesday, Dec 2, 2014 --- Migrating into R from other Statistical Software --- Andrey Koval   \n\n## Lecture Summaries\n\n\n**Oct 10, 2014**  \nAndrey Koval (University of Victoria)  \n[Toolbox and Skillset of Reproducible Research][lecture1]   \nThe lecture introduces reproducible research and demonstrates digital self-publishing with RStudio and Git (Hub). The skills described and emphasized in this workflow include data manipulation, graph production, statistical modeling, and dynamic reporting. A more elaborate discussion of each basic skill will be provided in the next four lectures.   \n[watch online](https://www.popdata.bc.ca/node/2035) or [download](https://www.sendthisfile.com/Ufnp3Bnb3IfjNP52KWqGKLdW)</br>     \n\n**Oct 21, 2014**    \nAndrey Koval (University of Victoria)  \n[RR Skills (1): Data Manipulation][lecture2]        \nThe lecture introduces the reproducible project that will be demonstrated during the lecture series. Topics: import and exploration of the raw data, project organization, techniques and practices of cleaning data, organizing the data workflow, reshaping data </br>   \n\n\n**Oct 28, 2014**  \nBrian Flaherty (University of Washington)  \nIntroduction to Latent Class and Latent Transition Models: Matching Models to Questions to Data\nLecture details to follow. </br> \n\n</br>\n**Nov 4, 2014**  \nAndrey Koval (University of Victoria)  \nRR Basic Skills (2): Graph Production  \nThe lecture introduces the grammar of graphics and its implementation in R.   \nTopics: basic R graphic utility; producing basic graphs with ggplot2; graph tuning and preparing your \ngraphs for publishing.  </br> \n\n\nNov 11, 2014       \nRemembrance Day </br>     \n\n\n**Nov 18, 2014**   \nAndrey Koval (University of Victoria)    \nRR Basic Skills (3): Statistical modeling    \nThe lecture introduces model fitting in R and discusses popular packages for estimating statistical \nmodels (lm, gls, lme4, etc.). Fitting of linear and mixed models of longitudinal data is demonstrated. \nThe strategy of organizing and post-processing of the model output is discussed. </br>  \n\n\n**Nov 25, 2014**  \nAndrey Koval (University of Victoria)  \nRR Basic Skills (4): Dynamic Reporting  \nThe lecture introduces publishing with knitr and rmarkdown packages inside RStudio. A brief tutorial on \nmarkdown language will be provided as well as a demonstration on integrating R code into reports, and \na discussion on the strategy of report production. Several output formats (pdf, html, slides) are \nconsidered.     </br>\n\n\n**Dec 2, 2014**  \nAndrey Koval (University of Victoria)  \nMigrating into R from other Statistical Software  \nThe lecture discusses the challenges and opportunities of multilingual estimation. \nShowcase: Longitudinal mixed model in syntax of R, Mplus, SAS, and SPSS. Costs and benefits of \nmultilingualism in estimation. In focus: R package MplusAutomation as the means to post-process Mplus \nestimation.  </br>\n\n[islandhealth]:./images/island_health_logo_full.jpg  \n[uviccoag]:./images/CentreOnAgingLogo.gif  \n[popdata]:./images/populationDataBc.jpg  \n[lecture1]:./2014-10-14-Toolbox-and-Skillset.html\n[lecture2]:./2014-10-21-Data-Manipulation.html\n[ialsa]:./images/logo_r.jpg\n\n",
