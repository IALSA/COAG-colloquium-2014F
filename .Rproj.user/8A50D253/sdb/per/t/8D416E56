A key emphasis is on advances in the health, \ncognitive vitality, and well-being of an aging community. This colloquium series has been developed to \nhighlight both substantive and methodological innovations and applications in aging research. This fall, \nour colloquium series emphasizes data management and statistical analysis using R software\n(http://www.r-project.org/) and statistical models for identifying trajectories and transitions in \nlongitudinal studies and administrative health data. This fall series will be of general interest to \nresearchers and students who wish to increase their expertise in statistical analysis using R.    </br>\n\n**Location**: University of Victoria, [Medical Sciences Building](http://www.uvic.ca/home/about/campus-info/maps/maps/msb.php), [Lecture Room 160](http://video.med.ubc.ca/videos/facilities/images/MSB160_1.jpg)   \n\n**Broadcast**: Sessions will also be available via live web streaming hosted by [WestGrid](http://www.westgrid.ca).

The skills described and emphasized in this workflow include data manipulation, graph production, statistical modeling, and dynamic reporting. A more elaborate discussion of each basic skill will be provided in the next four lectures.   \n[watch online](https://www.popdata.bc.ca/node/2035) or [download](https://www13.sendthisfile.com/iPOF37u8YpOCzoQtkP2h1HBc/Ufnp3Bnb3IfjNP52KWqGKLdW/popdata.trimmed.oct.14.2014.mp4)</br>     \n\n**Oct 21, 2014**    \nAndrey Koval (University of Victoria)  \n[RR Skills (1): Data Manipulation][lecture2]        \nThe lecture introduces the reproducible project that will be demonstrated during the lecture series. Topics: import and exploration of the raw data, project organization, techniques and practices of cleaning data, organizing the data workflow, reshaping data.       \n[watch online](https://www.popdata.bc.ca/node/2035) or [download](https://www6.sendthisfile.com/5G3TRDD7KPLpsexHAZyfRCgT/qJswiCQmpIBOknOg1TqMXKAy/popdata.oct.21.2014.mp4)</br>   \n\n\n\n**Oct 28, 2014**  \nBrian Flaherty (University of Washington)  \nIntroduction to Latent Class and Latent Transition Models: Matching Models to Questions to Data\nLecture details to follow. </br> \n\n</br>\n**Nov 4, 2014**  \nAndrey Koval (University of Victoria)  \n[RR Basic Skills (2): Graph Production][lecture3]  \nThe lecture introduces the grammar of graphics and its implementation in R.   \nTopics: basic R graphic utility; producing basic graphs with ggplot2; graph tuning and preparing your \ngraphs for publishing.  </br> \n\n\nNov 11, 2014       \nRemembrance Day </br>     \n\n\n**Nov 18, 2014**   \nAndrey Koval (University of Victoria)    \nRR Basic Skills (3): Statistical modeling    \nThe lecture introduces model fitting in R and discusses popular packages for estimating statistical \nmodels (lm, gls, lme4, etc.).
